# Access data

If you feel as lost as we did for accessing data, this wiki entry will be for you!



## Remote sensing

We focused on the following satellites
* Landsat
* Sentinel 2 a/b
* MODIS

### Data access

#### via Planetary Computer Hub
* For remote sensing data, there is a cool new tool from Microsoft, which lets you access all sorts of remote sensing data.
* You have to register, but currently (Dec 2023), it is free and we had no problems with getting access.





## Planetary science

We focused on the following spaceprobes
* CASSINI

### Data access

#### via NASA pds imaging server
* https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/portal/



### Use case: VIMS from Cassini

#### Step 1: access data "raw cube data"
* We tried the VIMS before (an imaging instrument from Cassini) 
* https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/vims.html

#### Step 2: open cub files
* Using the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers v3
* Looks very dodgy from the start, but it surprisingly works.
* It is a digital image processing software package to manipulate imagery collected by current and past NASA and International planetary missions. 
* Access it here: https://github.com/DOI-USGS/ISIS3



## Medical images

We focus on the following images
* OCT/OCTA
* Fundus
* Cells

### Data access
#### via Grand-Challenge 
* multiple datasets
* https://grand-challenge.org/
#### via IEEE 
* multiple datasets
* https://ieee-dataport.org/datasets
#### via Cellpose
* BLOB image dataset, including cells and other countable objects

## Sprint 2023-Q4 - "algaebra"

General information:
* Sience question: How does algae growth respond to other large scale environmental processes (aka la nino/temperature)?
* We use Landsat-8 and 9, MODIS Terra and Aqua, Sentinel-2a and 2b

Goals of this sprint:
* find one dataset they you are interested in
* create a jupyter notebook - we will do this in Python
* learn how to open the data
* perform exploratory data analysis
* visualise the data
* write a description on the dataset + literature review: what is it about, bias, timeframe, scale, what can be found in it, was it used before, ...
* optionally: perform simple classification/regression/segmentation/registration/correlation/clustering/explainability ... task
* optionally: visualise the results
* optionally: write a conclusion
* make a list with environmental crisis (for now - from the past 10 years)

:class: tip
#### ToDos:
* Alisa (A): learn about algae
* Christina (A): access el nino, la nina time series

#### Done:
* James (A): access Sentinel data - wrote script (2023-10-08)
* Alisa (A): access MAXAR data (obsolete)
* James (A): access ASTEAR data (obsolete)

#### Notes:
* we will focus on algae data and correlate it with temperature/el nino/la nina
* object detection can help by determining the area where algae grows
* aka we segment the whole area where algae exists and can analyse whether it shrinks or grows over the years
* so we would need two regions in the sea, where the algae has a lot of room to spread - one point has to be close to australia, and one close to south america for example
* see how they grow/shrink in two specific areas over the year and over a decade (or however long data we have)

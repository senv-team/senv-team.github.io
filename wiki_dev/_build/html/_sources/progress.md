# Progress and News

This is our progress board!

## Sprint

Goals of this sprint:
* List things here

`````{admonition} YYYY-MM-DD: Science/Coding Catch-Up
:class: tip
#### ToDos:
* Name (A = Attended): the todo we assigned this meeting (will be moved to done once it is done)
#### Done: 
* Name: the todo once it is done (date of done YYYY-MM-DD/obsolete)
#### Notes:
Anything worth mentioning

## Sprint 2023-Q4 - "dummy sprint name"

Goals of this sprint:
* find one dataset they you are interested in
* create a jupyter notebook - we will do this in Python
* learn how to open the data
* perform exploratory data analysis
* visualise the data
* write a description on the dataset + literature review: what is it about, bias, timeframe, scale, what can be found in it, was it used before, ...
* optionally: perform simple classification/regression/segmentation/registration/correlation/clustering/explainability ... task
* optionally: visualise the results
* optionally: write a conclusion
* make a list with environmental crisis (for now - from the past 10 years)

`````{admonition} 2023-09-30: Coding Catch-Up
#### ToDos:
* Stephen (A): Bokeh.js / bokeh Python library
* Sweta (A): NAS with SimCLR
#### Done:
* Christina (A): no new tasks
#### Notes:
* We will create jupyter notebooks for this jupyter book
`````


`````{admonition} 2023-09-28: Science Catch-Up
:class: tip
#### ToDos:
* Alisa (A): learn about algae
* Alisa (A): access MAXAR data
* James (A): access Sentinel data
* James (A): access ASTEAR data
* Christina (A): access el nino, la nina time series

#### Done:

#### Notes:
* we will focus on algae data and correlate it with temperature/el nino/la nina
* object detection can help by determining the area where algae grows
* aka we segment the whole area where algae exists and can analyse whether it shrinks or grows over the years
* so we would need two regions in the sea, where the algae has a lot of room to spread - one point has to be close to australia, and one close to south america for example
* see how they grow/shrink in two specific areas over the year and over a decade (or however long data we have)
`````

`````{admonition} 2023-09-23: Coding Catch-Up
#### ToDos:
* Sweta (A): focus on NAS
* Christina (A): focus on MIL
* Alisa: focus on geology/which data we can use for which task/why it is important to perform that task
* James: help Alisa
* James: do exploratory data analysis
* Stephen: do website stuff (we need to build a website to showcase our work)
* Stephen: help with data analysis

#### Done:
`````


`````{admonition} 2023-09-20: The start
:class: warning
#### ToDos:
#### Done:
* Christina (A): initial creation of jupyter book
* James (A): reads about "Solar activity and climate"
